<h1>Support</h1>
<p>Want to support the group? Why not try one of the following?</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Share us around! Like a series we do? Share it with others. Write a review. Do whatever you&rsquo;d like!</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Know someone who is willing to help and can read Korean, Chinese, or Japanese? Why not tell them about us?</p>
<p><strong>3)&nbsp;</strong>If you&rsquo;d like to support the group you can gift us a Amazon Japan Gift Card. In doing so we can go ahead and buy raws that we need and not have to pay as much out of pocket(no matter the size). We can provide receipts on what your gift was spent on. &nbsp;For example monthly Gakkou Gurashi chapters cost a total normally break down around&nbsp;<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2Fv3y3CTX.png&amp;t=NDcwZjA1ZTQ0YzA2M2EwM2U2M2Y2NTVmOGE2MDQ3MGU4ZTBjNTdlNixUbU4zdWpESg%3D%3D" target="_blank">here</a>. Gakkou Gurashi is the second cheapest magazine we have to buy monthly. The cheapest being XXXHolic Rei&rsquo;s magazine as it&rsquo;s luckily offered in a digital format. The most expense being Tatoe&rsquo;s magazine. Though they may be somewhat cheap the costs do build up over time. You can buy Gift Cards directly from Amazon Japan by going to <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.co.jp%2Fdp%2FB004N3APGY%2F&amp;t=ZDgxM2RkYWFkYWYzMWIxM2E0MDk4ZDA3NmVjMGY4NWNkYWYwZmI0MCxUbU4zdWpESg%3D%3D" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B004N3APGY/</a>. The page is in Japanese so we&rsquo;ve have a guide image for that which you can see <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fi.imgur.com%2F02JLWwJ.png&amp;t=YTEzY2QyM2ExMWU2MzhlMDQzZGQwOGQ5MzAyMDIxMTU0ODA0OGQ0OCxUbU4zdWpESg%3D%3D" target="_blank">here</a>. <strong>You will need</strong> a Amazon Japan account which is pretty much like creating any other amazon accounts. If you need help we&rsquo;ve created a guide which you can see <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fimgur.com%2Fa%2F4kbCM&amp;t=ZWMxN2I1MjUzODBiNGQ3ZGEwY2U4N2VlMTc0NzVmNWQxMTU0OGQ3YixUbU4zdWpESg%3D%3D" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>3b)</strong> After looking at the option of a Wish List. It was decided against due to it leaking personal information.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong>If you really want to gift some form of money you can gift Bitcoins. Any bitcoins will also be spent towards buying raws. Though bitcoins may also be used for renewing the domain name.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>4a)</strong>Please keep in mind with the price of Bitcoins changing constantly.
