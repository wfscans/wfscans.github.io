<p>Want to support the group? Why not try one of the following?</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Share us around! Like a series we do? Share it with others. Write a review. Do whatever you&rsquo;d like!</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> Know someone who is willing to help and can read Korean, Chinese, or Japanese? Why not tell them about us?</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong>We currently accept both Amazon Japan Gift Cards and Bitcon. You can purchase Amazon Japan Gift Cards directly from Amazon Japan. In doing this we can hopefully not have to pay completely out of pocket(all these volumes and mags cost real money ya know).
<ul>
 <li>Everything is in Japanese!! - <a href="http://imgur.com/a/smJy4">Follow these steps</a> to make it English.</li>
 <li>Gift Card... will something be mailed or is it digital? - Both options are there but I suggest Digital(I don't think gift cards ship outside japan).</li>
 <li>How do I create a Amazon Japan account? - Please follow <a href="http://imgur.com/a/4kbCM">this guide.</a> it'll show you how to create a JP account and link a payment method.</li>
 <li>Can I use a payment source outside japan? - If it supports international payments you <strong>should</strong> be able to use it on Amazon JP.
 <li>How do I go about buying a Amazon Japan Gift Card It's in Japanese! - Even if you do change the site to English(as mentioned above) this page will still be in Japanese don't panic. Go here <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B004N3APGY/" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B004N3APGY/</a>
 and follow <a href="http://imgur.com/02JLWwJ" target="_blank">this guide.</a></li>
 <li>How much is yen vs my currency? - You can visit <a href="http://www.x-rates.com/table/?from=JPY&amount=100">here to view the current exchange.</a>
 <li>Why don't you have a Wish List instead? Then I could just buy you something. - It would show off personal infomaiton during shipping. Though I <strong>may</strong> start using one for digital purchases magazines and books needed.</l1>
 <li>Where do I send the Gift Card? - Please send them to the contact address below.</li>
 <li>How do I know you are going to use it towards scanlation? - Recipts will be provided.</li>
 <li>How much does a Mag cost... it can't be that much. - For example here is <a href="http://i.imgur.com/LZEGDlO.png">the recipt</a> for Gakkou Gurashi's mag for August 2016. It might not look like a lot to you(well the mag price atleast)... but it easily piles up(shipping alone). Gakkou Gurashi is also one of the cheaper series.</li> 
</ul></p>
<p><strong>4)</strong>We use a certain forwarding service. If you'd like to gift credit towards that please contact us via email so we can give our referal information. Sometimes amazon won't ship to us so we have to buy it through proxy. Buying to proxy does raise the cost so we try to buy directly from Amazon or through a digital platform.</p>
